[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks, utilizing the functional programming paradigm. This extension integrates the powerfull string manipulation methods of Lodash into Visual Studio Code. With a simple hotkey, you can effortlessly convert text into various formats such as camelCase, kebab-case, snake_case, and more.

## Keybindings

You don't need to use the Command Palette all the time. Just create your own keybindings. Navigate to `Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts` and add a keybinding for the `lodash-string-tools.commands`. Simply type `Lodash String Tools` into the search bar to find the command.

Example of keybindings.json file:

```json
{
  "key": "shift+cmd+l",
  "command": "lodash-string-tools.commands"
}
```

Now you can select the text in the editor and press `Shift + Cmd + L` activate the extension commands menu.

## Additional methods

In addition to the Lodash string methods, this extension also provides a few non-standard string methods:

- snakeCaseUpper - like snakeCase, but with uppercase letters, e.g. "fooBar" -> "FOO_BAR"
